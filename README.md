# OpenLoginAPI
This project is an Interview assessment for an entry-level role. This API is a Login API used to grant authentication to user and was created using ASP.NET Web API targeting .NET Core runtime and SQL as the database. LINQ was written to query the database and EF Core was used as the Database provider

The Login Web API was consumed with a frontend framework built using Angular 11 (Here is the link to the Anglar frontend that consumed the API).

The App was deployed to Heroku using Docker by conteainerizing the App before deployment.
